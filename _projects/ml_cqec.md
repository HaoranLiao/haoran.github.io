We were invited for a talk on our paper *Machine Learning for Continuous Quantum Error Correction on Superconducting Qubits* at the biweekly colloquium of <a href="https://quantumsystemsaccelerator.org/">Quantum Systems Accelerator</a> in January 2022. You may learn more about it in our slides below. You can also check us out at the <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR22/Session/T40.13">2022 American Physical Society (APS) March Meeting</a>.
