Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are rapid (millisecond duration) and bright radio transients that appear to come from extragalactic origins. The nature of FRBs is still a mystery. The leading theories suggest that FRBs come from incredibly volatile cosmic events, such as material being ejected from supermassive black holes, the explosions of superluminous supernovae, or rotating young magnetars.

I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the team led by Prof. Victoria Kaspi at McGill Space Institute (MSI) to search for FRBs using the CHIME telescope. The CHIME (Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment) telescope, whose primary goal is to map the red-shifted 21 cm hydrogen in order to study Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at redshifts of 0.8-2.5, has a huge field of view that also makes it an ideal instrument to search
for FRBs. The FRB search using CHIME has been in operation since 2018.
