Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are rapid and bright radio transients that appear to come from extragalactic origins. The nature of FRBs is still a mystery. The leading theories suggest that FRBs come from incredibly volatile cosmic events, such as material being ejected from supermassive black holes, the explosions of superluminous supernovae, or rotating young magnetars.

I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the team led by <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~vkaspi/">Prof. Victoria Kaspi</a> at <a href="https://msi.mcgill.ca/">McGill Space Institute (MSI)</a> to search for FRBs using the CHIME telescope. The CHIME (Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment) telescope, whose primary goal is to map the red-shifted 21 cm hydrogen in order to study Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at redshifts of 0.8-2.5, has a huge field of view that also makes it an ideal instrument to search
for FRBs. The FRB search using CHIME has been in operation since 2018.
