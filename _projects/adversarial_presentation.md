I gave a talk at the <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR21/Session/S32.13">2021 American Physical Society (APS) March Meeting</a> on our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08544.pdf">*Robust in Practice: Adversarial Attacks on Quantum Machine Learning*</a>. Below are extended slides showing that theoretically, we argue against the extreme, exponential vulnerabilities of general QML and show mild, polynomial vulnerabilities instead on practically relevant states to be classified.
