My term paper for the general relativity course at Berkeley was a guide through Edward Witten's proof in 1981 of the positive energy theorem. He was awarded the Fields Medal partially because of this proof. The theorem asserts under appropriate assumptions that the total energy of a gravitating system is always positive and can be zero only if the geometry of spacetime is that of flat Minkowski space. It establishes Minkowski space as a stable ground state of the gravitational field. Witten's proof simplified the original proof of this theorem.
