I worked as an undergraduate researcher at <a href="http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/leslielab/alumni.html#top">Leslie Lab</a> for two years at McGill University Department of Physics. I studied Convex Lens-induced Confinement (CLiC) microscopy developed by <a href="https://leslielab.msl.ubc.ca/sabrina-leslie/">Prof. Sabrina Leslie </a> and its applications in nanoparticle super resolution imaging as well as physical property measurements. By confining the nanoparticles in micro-scale cylindrical wells with TIRF microscopy, applying a circular confined diffusion model and simulations to obtain the size distribution of the nanoparticle, as well as using the photobleaching effect to count the number of fluorophores attached, we were able to measure the hydrodynamic radius of single nanoparticle on the order of 10 nm and the average number of fluorophores attached to a single nanoparticle.

My presentation was awarded Second Prize at the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/science/research/undergraduate-research/urc/2017">2017 Undergraduate Research Conference</a>):
