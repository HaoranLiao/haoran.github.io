I am a Physics Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/kbwgrp/index.php/People/BirgittaWhaley">Prof. K. Birgitta Whaley's group</a> studying quantum information and computation. I do research on quantum machine learning, quantum error correction and superconducting qubits. Here is my research <a href='https://marwahaha.github.io/arxiv-wordcloud/?author=Haoran%20Liao'>wordcloud</a>. I am co-supervised by <a href="http://qnl.berkeley.edu/team-view/team/">Prof. Irfan Siddiqi</a>.

My projects, publications and teaching experience can be accessed through the tabs at the top. Besides physics, I am also interested in machine learning, computer science and their interplays with physics.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing the piano, traveling and I try to take good <a href="https://lhr.myportfolio.com/">photographs</a>.
