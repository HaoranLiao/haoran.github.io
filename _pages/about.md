I'm a Physics Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/kbwgrp/index.php/People/BirgittaWhaley">K. Birgitta Whaley</a>'s group studying quantum information and computation. Welcome to check out my talks, slides, and code repos on my papers and projects through the navigation bar on top.
<!---Quantum computing doesn't use transistors and digital logic. It operates under quantum mechanics and uses logic based on quantum state evolution and manipulation, which offers huge speedups in solving certain problems. -->

I research (variational) quantum algorithms, tensor networks, and quantum error mitigation/suppression/characterization/correction. Here's my research <a href='https://marwahaha.github.io/arxiv-wordcloud/?author=Haoran%20Liao'>word cloud</a>. I'm co-supervised by <a href="http://qnl.berkeley.edu/team-view/team/">Irfan Siddiqi</a>. Besides physics, I'm also interested in machine learning, computer science, and their interplays with physics. 

I recently completed a six-month research internship at IBM Quantum, under the supervision of <a href='https://www.zlatko-minev.com/'>Zlatko Minev</a>, where I researched quantum error mitigation/suppression as well as benchmarking/noise characterization.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking and playing the piano. I also like photography---here are my <a href="https://lhr.myportfolio.com/">portfolio</a> and <a href="https://500px.com/p/haoranliao?view=photos">500px</a>.
