I'm a research scientist at <a href="https://q-ctrl.com/">Q-CTRL</a>, trying to understand what impacts quantum computers can make in the real world, and how it can help physicists. 

<!-- My research interest lies in generative QML, QEC, quantum algorithms for PDEs, and TN approximation of many-body dynamics.-->

I researched quantum error mitigation/suppression/correction, error characterization, quantum machine learning, tensor network, open-system dynamics, superconducting qubit, etc. Here's my research <a href='https://marwahaha.github.io/arxiv-wordcloud/?author=Haoran%20Liao'>word cloud</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics from UC Berkeley, supervised by K. Birgitta Whaley. I also interned at IBM Quantum, supervised by Zlatko K. Minev. Welcome to check out my talks, slides, and code repos on my papers and projects, as well as my CV, through the navigation bar.

Besides physics, I'm also interested in machine learning, computer science, and their interplays with physics.
In my free time, I enjoy hiking and playing the piano. I also like photography---here are my <a href="https://lhr.myportfolio.com/">portfolio</a> and <a href="https://500px.com/p/haoranliao?view=photos">500px</a>.
