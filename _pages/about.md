I'm a Physics Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/kbwgrp/index.php/People/BirgittaWhaley">Prof. K. Birgitta Whaley</a>'s group studying quantum information and computation. 
<!---Quantum computing doesn't use transistors and digital logic. It operates under quantum mechanics and uses logic based on quantum state evolution and manipulation, which offers huge speedups in solving certain problems. -->

I research quantum error mitigation/suppression, tensor networks, quantum machine learning, benchmarking/noise characterization, quantum error correction, and superconducting qubits. Here's my research <a href='https://marwahaha.github.io/arxiv-wordcloud/?author=Haoran%20Liao'>word cloud</a>. I'm co-supervised by <a href="http://qnl.berkeley.edu/team-view/team/">Prof. Irfan Siddiqi</a>. Besides physics, I'm also interested in machine learning, computer science, and their interplays with physics. My projects, papers, and talks can be found through the navigation bar.

I am a research intern at IBM Quantum for six months in 2023.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, and playing the piano. I also like photography -- here are my <a href="https://lhr.myportfolio.com/">portfolio</a> and <a href="https://500px.com/p/haoranliao?view=photos">500px</a>.
