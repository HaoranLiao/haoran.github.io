#### Education

* Ph.D. Physics, University of California, Berkeley
<br> Dissertation: Interplay between quantum computation and machine learning
* B.Sc. Honours Mathematics and Physics, McGill University, Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec

#### Experience
* Senior Research Scientist, Q-CTRL
<br> 01/2024&ndash;Present &emsp; Los Angeles, United States
  * Application team
* Research Intern, IBM Quantum
<br> 02/2023&ndash;08/2023 &emsp; New York, United States
  * Led the research effort in machine learning-based quantum error mitigation, designing and running experiments. Demonstrated that our method outperforms ZNE
on small-scale circuits, and scales to classically intractable circuits with lower overhead in a 100-qubit experiment. Showed its superiority for variational algorithms
such as VQE, and for tomography-like experiments.
  * Performed experiments and analysis for Pauli channel estimation using
  entanglement-assisted benchmarking. Developed e.g., the codebase to perform randomized compiling (single-Clifford twirling) for ECR gates, and staggered dynamical decoupling. Researched and enabled
  methods to suppress crosstalks.

[//]: # (  on Heisenberg model simulations.)

* Ph.D. Student Researcher, UC Berkeley
<br> 09/2018&ndash;12/2023 &emsp; Berkeley, United States
  * Analytically and numerically studied decoherence in tensor network discriminative QML models and
their connections to classical Bayesian networks. Showed that adding noisy ancillas helps mitigate decoherence effect in simulations with distributed GPU training.
  * Developed a novel protocol based on the RNN/LSTM for continuous quantum error correction with dispersive readout
  measurements on superconducting qubits. The protocol decodes the errors and applies active corrections. Benchmarked against
  our Bayesian inference model (similar to hidden Markov models) on tasks including adiabatic quantum computing.
  * Derived the robustness of general quantum classifiers against worst-case input perturbations based on the concentration
  of measure phenomenon in SU(N) equipped with the Haar measure. Argued against the previous belief of vulnerability in generic quantum classifiers and proved that their
  practical robustness decreases only mildly polynomially in the number of qubits.
