  title={Machine Learning for Continuous Quantum Error Correction on Superconducting Qubits},
  author={Liao, H. and Convy, I. and Zhang, S. and Patel, S. and Livingston, W. and Siddiqi, I. and Whaley, KB.},
  abstract={We propose a machine learning algorithm for continuous quantum error correction that is based on the use of a recurrent neural network to identity bit-flip errors from continuous noisy syndrome measurements. The algorithm is designed to operate on measurement signals deviating from the ideal behavior in which the mean value corresponds to a code syndrome value and the measurement has white noise. We analyze continuous measurements taken from a superconducting architecture using three transmon qubits to identify three significant practical examples of non-ideal behavior, namely auto-correlation at temporal short lags, transient syndrome dynamics after each bit-flip, and drift in the steady-state syndrome values over the course of many experiments. Based on these real-world imperfections, we generate synthetic measurement signals from which to train the recurrent neural network, and then test its proficiency when implementing active error correction, comparing this with a traditional double threshold scheme and a discrete Bayesian classifier. The results show that our machine learning protocol is able to outperform the double threshold protocol across all tests, achieving a final state fidelity comparable to the discrete Bayesian classifier.},

  title={Adversarial Robustness of Quantum Machine Learning Models},
  author={Liao, H. and Convy, I. and Huggins, W. and Whaley, KB.},
  abstract={State-of-the-art classical neural networks are observed to be vulnerable to small crafted adversarial perturbations. A more severe vulnerability has been noted for quantum machine learning (QML) models classifying Haar-random pure states. This stems from the concentration of measure phenomenon, a property of the metric space when sampled probabilistically, and is independent of the classification protocol. To provide insights into the adversarial robustness of a quantum classifier on real-world classification tasks, we focus on the adversarial robustness in classifying a subset of encoded states that are smoothly generated from a Gaussian latent space. We show that the vulnerability of this task is considerably weaker than that of classifying Haar-random pure states. In particular, we find only mildly polynomially decreasing robustness in the number of qubits, in contrast to the exponentially decreasing robustness when classifying Haar-random pure states and suggesting that QML models can be useful for real-world classification tasks.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
